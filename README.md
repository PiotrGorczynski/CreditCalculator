<p align="justify"> The calculator allows you to see how the monthly rate will be shaped. The calculator generates a detailed rate repayment schedule,
broken down into the principal and interest part of the repayment along with the current debt balance. It has a division into rates: constant and decreasing.
Banks charge interest on the current debt balance, which is why each overpayment of the loan (decrease in the debt balance) is associated with charging lower interest.
The calculator allows you to check how much you will save - by overpaying the loan. Some banks charge fees for early repayment or overpayment of the loan. 
Thus, the entire calculator will allow us to determine whether the option we have chosen is profitable or whether there are other - more profitable ones.
